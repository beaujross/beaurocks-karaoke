Last updated: 2026-01-17

These terms apply to the BeauRocks Karaoke experience ("BROSS Karaoke," "we," "us") and the web app used by hosts, singers, and audience members (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these terms and our Privacy Policy.

## 3) Your content
You may submit content like names, messages, photos, and drawings ("UGC"). You keep ownership of your UGC, but you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use it to run and promote the Service (e.g., on the TV display, highlight reels, or recap pages). We may remove UGC that violates these terms.

## 6) Third-party services
The Service may integrate with platforms like YouTube, Apple Music, Stripe, or Twilio. We are not responsible for third-party outages or content.

## 7) No warranties
The Service is provided "as is." We do not guarantee uninterrupted service or error-free operation.

## 8) Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages related to the Service.

## 9) Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these terms.
