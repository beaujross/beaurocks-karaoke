# BeauRocks Marketing Brief

## Objective
- Position BeauRocks as a private-party platform inspired by karaoke, not a bar-only karaoke tool.
- Capture early demand with a waitlist-first homepage.
- Explain the three product surfaces and game modes in depth.

## Core Positioning
- BeauRocks modernizes both roles in party karaoke culture: performers and audience participants.
- The product focus is private gatherings where hosts control pacing, tone, and participation.
- Karaoke is the foundation; the full platform includes Bingo, Trivia, Tight 15, and Sweet 16 Bracket.

## Audience
- Home party hosts and private event organizers.
- Fundraiser planners and community organizers.
- Venue/KJ operators looking for multi-mode engagement.

## Conversion Goals
- Primary: join early access waitlist.
- Secondary: request host demo.
- Tertiary: explore host subscription options.

## Messaging Pillars
- Three synced surfaces: Public Screen, Host Panel, Audience App.
- "Everyone has a role" participation model.
- Host presets for different night formats.
- VIP continuity across rooms.
- Dedicated fundraiser workflows.
- AI assist that supports karaoke flow without replacing the karaoke core.

## AI Feature Story (Succinct)
- **Lyrics Recovery**: If a queued song has no usable lyrics, the system attempts cached lyrics, then Apple lyrics, then AI fallback.
- **Pop Trivia Companion**: During songs, AI can generate short trivia moments to engage non-singers.
- **Game Content Copilot**: Hosts can generate selfie prompts, bingo boards, and trivia/WYR banks quickly.

## AI Use Cases To Communicate
- Keep momentum in live rooms when songs have metadata gaps.
- Give non-singers lightweight participation between performances.
- Reduce host prep time for recurring nights and private events.
- Preserve karaoke-first pacing while still adding novelty.

## AI Guardrails To Communicate
- Usage is quota-based and meter-tracked per workspace.
- Generated lyrics and timed lyrics are cached so successful outputs are reused.
- AI tools are host-gated by subscription capability.

## Fundraiser Story
- Showcase mode-driven donation mechanics:
- Bingo card sales and sponsored squares.
- Trivia team entries and sponsored rounds.
- Bracket donation voting moments.
- Host overlays for goals/callouts and recap sharing.

## Licensing Guardrail
- Do not claim licensing exemption or bypass.
- Approved language:
- "Built for private gatherings and party nights."
- "Hosts are responsible for music-rights compliance based on local rules and event context."

- FAQ

## Visual Direction
- Bold party-night energy with chaptered scroll storytelling.
- Inspired by cinematic parallax pacing (reference: hadaka.jp), without copying brand visuals.
- Motion should degrade cleanly for reduced-motion users and mobile.
