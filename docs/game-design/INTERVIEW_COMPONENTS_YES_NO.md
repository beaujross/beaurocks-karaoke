Answer each question with `Yes` or `No`.

6. Should Tight 15 meaningfully influence queue priority for that singer?
7. Should Tight 15 be treated as a public identity card rather than private preference list?
8. Should Tight 15 entries require minimal metadata quality (title + artist) before save?

10. Should host be able to feature a singer's Tight 15 entry during spotlight moments?

## Round 3: Spotlight + Social Recognition

11. Should spotlight be time-limited by default to prevent over-focus on one user?

13. Should spotlight text/messages require stricter moderation than normal chat?
14. Should spotlight selection aim to rotate across users instead of repeat favorites?
15. Should users be able to opt out of being spotlighted?

## Round 4: Combo / Multiplier / Energy Loops

16. Should combo gain be mostly based on participation volume rather than performer skill?
17. Should multipliers affect points only, not queue order or eligibility?
18. Should combo decay quickly when participation drops to keep urgency high?
19. Should there be hard caps to prevent runaway multiplier inflation?
20. Should VIP/paid actions boost visuals more than score impact?

23. Should per-user queue caps be visible to everyone in the room UI?

## Round 6: Chat / DM / VIP Social

26. Should chat remain enabled by default unless host explicitly disables it?
27. Should VIP-only chat be a temporary mode rather than all-night default?
28. Should slow mode defaults be conservative (off or very low) unless spam appears?
29. Should host DMs always bypass public chat filters/rate limits?
30. Should moderation actions (mute/hide) be silent to room but visible to target user?

## Round 7: Tips / Points / Economy

33. Should points inflation be actively controlled with sinks/caps?
34. Should premium purchases prioritize cosmetic/status value over competitive value?
35. Should point conversion rates be transparent in UI at all times?

## Round 8: Ready Check + Vibe Multiplayer

38. Should high-intensity vibe modes auto-expire unless host re-activates?
39. Should accessibility-safe alternatives exist for strobe/flash-heavy moments?
