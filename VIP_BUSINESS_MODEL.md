## 📊 REVENUE MODEL

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

```
Assumptions:
- 1,000 total players by Month 6
- 15% conversion to monthly VIP (150 users)
- 5% conversion to annual VIP (50 users converted/mo)

Month 6 MRR:
- Monthly VIPs: 150 × $9.99 = $1,498.50
- Annual VIPs: (50 × $99.99) / 12 = $416.58
- Total: ~$1,915/month

Year 1 Cumulative Revenue:
- 150 monthly × $9.99 × 12 = $17,982
- 600 annual × $99.99 / 12 = $4,999.50
- **Total: ~$23,000** (conservative estimate)

Year 2 with Growth (2x users):
- 400 monthly × $9.99 × 12 = $47,952
- 1,500 annual × $99.99 / 12 = $12,499.50
- **Total: ~$60,500**
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

```
Average Customer LTV:
- Assume 70% monthly, 30% annual
- Average monthly duration: 6 months before churn
- Average annual duration: 2 years before churn

Blended LTV:
= (0.7 × $9.99 × 6) + (0.3 × $99.99 × 2)
= $41.96 + $59.99
= ~$102/customer

With 10% payment failure rate and churn:
Realistic LTV: ~$75-90/customer
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

```
Proposed strategy: ORGANIC
- App store optimization
- Word-of-mouth (free tier → paid)
- Content marketing (karaoke guides)
- Community building (Discord, Reddit)

Target: $0-5 CAC (product-led growth)

This means:
- LTV/CAC Ratio: $75/$5 = 15:1 ✅ (healthy is >3:1)
- Payback period: ~3-4 months
```

## 🎁 FAME SYSTEM AS MONETIZATION LEVER

### Why Players Buy VIP

The Fame system creates FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):

1. **Competition**: Public leaderboards show "Legend" players with 15+ levels
2. **Progression**: Free players at Level 5 vs VIP at Level 8+ (same playtime)
3. **Status**: VIP badge visible on profiles during gameplay
4. **Exclusivity**: Level 15+ unlocks private hosting (VIP feature)

### The Hook

```
Free Player Experience:
- Play game, get 150 hype points
- Decibel bonus: 50 points
- Host bonus: none (public party)
- Total: 200 Fame Points
- Level: 0-2 after many sessions

Same Player with VIP:
- Play game, get 150 hype points
- Decibel bonus: 50 points
- Host bonus: 1.5x (from VIP host)
- Fame multiplier: 1.5x (VIP sub)
- Total: (150 + 50 + 225) × 1.5 = 562.5 → 562 Fame Points
- Level progression: 2-3x faster!
```

### Upgrade Hooks at Key Points

1. **After Level 5 (2 hours in)**
   - Show popup: "Become a Legend! Host with 1.5x multiplier"
   - Trial: 7-day free VIP trial

2. **After First Performance with Host Bonus**
   - Show: "You earned 412 points today! VIP members earn 618+ with 1.5x"
   - CTA: "Try VIP Free for 7 Days"

3. **Approaching Level 15**
   - Show: "Unlock private hosting at Level 15! Hosts earn even more 🎉"
   - Feature unlock preview

4. **In Leaderboard**
   - Show VIP badge next to high-level players
   - "Be a Legend - Upgrade to VIP"

---

## 🏆 LEVEL 15+ EXCLUSIVE: HOSTING

### Why Level 15+ Gets Hosting

Creates a progression path:
- Level 1-5: Learn to play, earn fame
- Level 5-10: Become recognized player
- Level 10-15: Achieve competitive skill
- **Level 15+: Unlock hosting privilege**

This ties Fame directly to hosting capability, making progression rewarding.

### Alternative: Direct Feature Unlock

Could also be:
- "Level 5+ OR VIP can host"
- "Level 10+ can host private parties"
- "Level 15+ unlock advanced hosting" (VIP+ feature)

## 🎵 CUSTOM SONGS - VALUE & DIFFERENTIATION

### Current State
- Built-in songs limited to library

### VIP Value
- **Monthly**: 100 custom songs (covers most use cases)
- **Annual**: 500 custom songs (semi-professional use)

### Implementation
1. User uploads MP3 or YouTube URL
2. Firebase Storage stores files
3. SongService converts to playable format
4. Stored per user, usable in private parties
5. Cost: ~$0.10-0.50 per hosted party in storage

### Revenue Implications
- Unlimited uploads (fixed cost to user)
- Variable cost to us (storage)
- Marginal profit from upsell feature
